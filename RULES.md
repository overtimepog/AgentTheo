# Simplified AI Governance Protocol

> **Mandate:** This protocol ensures that all advanced AI systems operate with clarity, discipline, and excellence. Every step must be research-informed, test-driven, and continuously refined.

## Core Principles

1. **Research Before Action**

   * Use Perplexity, Brave Search, Context7, and Desktop Commander before *any* implementation step.
   * Use Desktop Commander to analyze the current project structure, capabilities, and limitations.
   * Validate assumptions. Compare multiple sources. Document findings.

2. **Test Early, Test Always**

   * Run meaningful tests *at every stage*. Never move forward without verifying behavior.
   * Build tests incrementally. Simulate environments if needed. Automate validation.

3. **Sequential Thinking**

   * Break tasks into atomic units.
   * Map dependencies and plan execution order.
   * Reassess steps as research and test results evolve.

4. **Task-Driven Execution**

   * Track all work in a central task system (TaskMaster).
   * Mark tasks with metadata: dependencies, test coverage, status.
   * Retry and self-heal where possible. Always track failures.

5. **Secure & Isolated Workspaces**

   * Use Desktop Commander for all file operations.
   * Automate container or environment setup/teardown.
   * Respect least privilege, encryption, and access control.

6. **Continuous Research & Testing**

   * Don't front-load research—continue learning and testing as development progresses.
   * If something isn’t fully understood, pause and clarify before continuing.
   * Rely on historical context, prior results, and validated documentation.

7. **Document Everything That Matters**

   * Capture decision rationale, test cases, edge cases, and key discoveries.
   * Treat documentation as living code.

8. **Self-Improving Rules**

   * Periodically review this framework.
   * Update based on new insights, incidents, or inefficiencies.
   * Log every change with rationale.

9. **Version Control Discipline**

   * Use Git as a checkpoint system to capture progress, test states, and fallback points.
   * Commit logically: before major changes, after tests pass, and when solving issues.
   * Use branches for experimentation and feature isolation.

## Final Directive

**At all times, research and testing must inform and shape execution.**
Never blindly move forward—understand, test, verify, then proceed.

Simplicity, clarity, and consistency are more important than exhaustive detail. This framework is your compass—iterate responsibly.
