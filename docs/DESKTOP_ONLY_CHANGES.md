# Desktop-Only Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Browser Agent has been converted to run exclusively in desktop mode with GUI visibility via VNC/noVNC. All headless functionality has been removed.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Browser Configuration (`agent/browser_tools.py`)
- Set `headless = False` permanently
- Removed HEADLESS environment variable checks
- Added desktop-specific browser arguments
- Updated log messages to indicate desktop mode

### 2. Docker Configuration
- **Dockerfile**: Added DISPLAY=:1 environment variable
- **docker-entrypoint.sh**: New script to start X11, VNC, and noVNC services
- **docker-compose.yml**: Removed HEADLESS variable, added ports 5901 and 6080
- **Added .dockerignore**: Optimized build context

### 3. CLI Script (`run.sh`)
- Removed "desktop" command - only "task" remains
- Task always runs with desktop environment
- Container runs with exposed VNC/noVNC ports
- Added automatic log following

### 4. Documentation
- **README.md**: Updated to reflect desktop-only mode
- Removed separate desktop mode documentation
- Added GUI access instructions prominently

### 5. Removed Files
- `entrypoint_wrapper.sh` (no longer needed)
- `docs/DESKTOP_MODE.md` (integrated into README)
- `docs/CHANGES.md` (outdated)

## Usage

```bash
# Only one way to run tasks now:
./run.sh task "your browser automation task"

# Access the GUI:
# Web: http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
# VNC: vnc://localhost:5901
```

## Benefits
- Simplified codebase with single mode
- Always visual debugging available
- Easier to understand automation behavior
- No mode switching complexity

## Technical Details
- Xvfb provides virtual display on :1
- x11vnc serves VNC on port 5901
- noVNC provides web interface on port 6080
- Fluxbox window manager for desktop environment
- No password required for simplified access
