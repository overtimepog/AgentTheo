# Container Environment Fix: Early Task Completion Issue

## Problem Description

The BrowserBase agent was returning early with "Task completed successfully. The agent performed all requested actions." in the container environment, even though it hadn't actually executed the requested tasks.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **model compatibility problem**:

1. **Default Model Issue**: When the `LLM_MODEL` environment variable wasn't set in the container, the code defaulted to `deepseek/deepseek-chat`
2. **Function Calling Support**: The deepseek model **does not support function calling** (tool use), which is required for the agent to execute browser automation tools
3. **Fallback Behavior**: When the LLM couldn't call tools, it would only produce "planning" messages (e.g., "I will navigate to...", "Let me search for...") but never actually execute them
4. **Generic Response**: The agent would detect all messages as planning messages and return the generic "Task completed successfully" message

## Solution

### 1. Changed Default Model
- Updated the default model from `deepseek/deepseek-chat` to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- The new default model supports function calling properly

### 2. Added Model Validation
- Added logging to display which model is being used
- Added warnings when using models that don't support function calling

### 3. Enhanced Error Detection
- Added detailed logging when all AI messages are planning messages
- Added warning that this typically happens with non-function-calling models

## Files Modified

1. **`agent/llm/openrouter_chat.py`**
   - Changed default model to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
   - Added model compatibility checking

2. **`agent/core/main.py`**
   - Added model configuration logging
   - Enhanced message analysis logging
   - Added warnings for function-calling issues

3. **Created debugging tools**:
   - `debug_container_issue.py` - Debug script to analyze agent behavior
   - `docker/debug-entrypoint.sh` - Debug mode for container
   - `fix_container_env.sh` - Script to fix environment configuration

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Run the fix script**:
   ```bash
   ./fix_container_env.sh
   ```

2. **Ensure your `.env` file has the correct model**:
   ```env
   LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
   ```

3. **Rebuild the container**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build
   ```

4. **Test the fix**:
   ```bash
   TASK_DESCRIPTION='Go to google.com and search for AI news' \
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
   ```

## Supported Models for Function Calling

The following models support function calling and will work properly:
- OpenAI: `gpt-4`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`
- Anthropic: `claude-3-opus`, `claude-3-sonnet`, `claude-3-haiku`
- Google: `gemini-pro`, `gemini-pro-1.5`
- Others: `arcee-ai/arcee-caller`, `zhipuai/glm-4`

## Debugging

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check the logs for model info**:
   ```
   Using LLM model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
   Model temperature: 0.7
   Max tokens: 2000
   ```

2. **Run in debug mode**:
   ```bash
   DEBUG_MODE=true TASK_DESCRIPTION='test task' \
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
   ```

3. **Look for function calling warnings**:
   ```
   WARNING - All X AI messages were either planning (Y) or empty (Z)
   WARNING - This typically happens when the LLM model doesn't support function calling properly
   ```

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always specify `LLM_MODEL` in your `.env` file
2. Use a model that supports function calling
3. Monitor logs for function calling warnings
4. Test the agent with simple tasks first to verify tool execution
