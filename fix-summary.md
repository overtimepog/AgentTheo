# Resize Bug Fix Summary

## Changes Made:

1. **Removed pointer capture**: Removed `setPointerCapture` calls that were conflicting with document-level events

2. **Added full-viewport overlay**: Created a transparent overlay that covers the entire viewport during resize to prevent iframe interference

3. **Moved event listeners to document**: Pointer move/up events are now attached to document instead of the resizer element

4. **Added debugging**: Console logs to help verify the overlay is being created/removed

## Key Code Changes:
- Removed `this.resizer.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId)` 
- Moved `pointermove` and `pointerup` listeners from resizer to document
- Created full-screen overlay instead of per-iframe overlays
- Added semi-transparent background for debugging (change to transparent for production)

## Testing:
The overlay will appear as a slight dark tint when resizing - this confirms it's working. Change line 190 from `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)` to `transparent` to remove the tint in production.
